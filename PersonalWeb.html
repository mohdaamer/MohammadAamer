            <p><strong>Playing Cricket</strong><br><strong>Description : </strong> Childhood Dream of every boy to become a Cricketer Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two
                teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at
                each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking
                the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets.Forms of cricket
                range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of
                6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score)</p>

            <p> <strong>Watching Web Series </strong><br> <strong>Description :</strong> A web series (also known as a web show) is a series of scripted or non-scripted online videos, generally in episodic form, released on the Internet, which first emerged in the late 1990s and became more
            prominent in the early 2000s. A single instance of a web series program can be called an episode or a
            "webisode", however the term is not always used. In general, web series can be watched on a range of
            platforms and devices, including desktop, laptop, tablets and smartphones. They are different from
            streaming television, which can be watched on various streaming platforms.</p>

            <p> <strong>Coding</strong> <br> <strong>Description :</strong> Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers.</p>

Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae.[8] While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous. </p>

        <p> <strong>Have Knowledge in Python Programming </strong>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[32]
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[36]
            Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages</p>

        <p>Have Knowledge on JAVA Programming Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]</p>
